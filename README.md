# Playing-with-Sparse-Matrices
This repository contains the code files related to an assignment-project that I did on sparse matrices.
The project explored the following things:
  - Understanding Sparse Matrices
  - Understanding how they are stored
  - Exploring an efficient way of storing them (using linked lists)
  - Performing various Arithmetic operations on Sparse Matrices
